# Project Mongo API

For week 14 of the Technigo frontend developer boot camp out assignment was to create a database using MongoDB and fetch data from it using an Express API. One endpoint had to return a single item and one endpoint should return a collection.

## The problem

I seeded data to the database from a downloaded json file with song data.
I decided on using params to fetch data for the different endpoints. At the root you get a list of the endpoints, other than that there are three in total: get all songs, get song by id and get songs by genre.

If I had more time, I'd like to use queries to sort data with multiple parameters.
